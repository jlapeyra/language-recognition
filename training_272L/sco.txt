Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra[b] (Spaingie: [miˈɣel de θerˈβantes saaˈβeðɾa];  29 September 1547 (assumed) – 22 Aprile 1616)[2] wis a Spanish screiver an makar. His maist weel-kent buik is Don Quijote de la Mancha. It is thocht tae be the first novelle furthset.
Kālidāsa (Sanskrit: कालिदासः) wis a Clessical Sanskrit writer, widely regairdit as the greatest poet an dramatist in the Sanskrit leid. His plays an poetry are primarily based on the Indie Puranas.[1]
Much aboot his life is unkent, anerly whit can be inferred frae his poetry an plays.[2] His floruit canna be datit wi preceesion, but maist likely faws within the 5t century CE.[3]
Édith Piaf (French: [edit pjaf] ( listen); 19 December 1915 – 10 October 1963; born Édith Giovanna Gassion) wis a French cabaret sangster, sangwriter an actress wha acame widely regairdit as Fraunce's naitional chanteuse, as well as bein ane o Fraunce's greatest internaitional starns.[1]
Her muisic wis eften autobiografical wi her sangin reflectin her life, an her specialty bein chanson an torch ballads, pairteecularly o luve, loss an sorrae. Amang her well-kent sangs are "La Vie en rose" (1946), "Non, je ne regrette rien" (1960), "Hymne à l'amour" (1949), "Milord" (1959), "La Foule" (1957), "L'Accordéoniste [fr]" (1955), an "Padam ... Padam ..." (1951).
Syne her premature daith in 1963 an wi the aid o several biografies an films includin 2007's Academy Awaird winnin La Vie en rose, Piaf haes acquired a legacy as ane o the greatest performers o the 20t century, an her vyce an muisic continue tae be celebratit globally.[2]
James Cook (7 November [A.S. 27 Oktober] 1728 – 14 Februar 1779) wis a Breetish explorer an a navigator. He was a cairt maker forbye. He made three voyages tae the Paceefic Ocean, chairtin its main shorelines.
James Cook was born in Marton in North Yorkshire on 7 November [A.S. 27 Oktober] 1728, naur whit is the day recognized as the town of Middlesbrough. Cook was ane o five bairns born tae Grace an James, Sr., wha wrocht as a day labourer on a ferm. As a bairn, Cook flittit wi his familie tae Great Ayton. 
Whan Cook wis saxteen, he wis prenticed tae a shopkeeper in the fishin clachan o Staithes. Gaun bi tradeetion, it wis durin his time thare that Cook first felt the tice o the sea whan govin oot the shop windae. Efter aboot a year an a hauf in Staithes, the shop fiar brocht Cook tae the naurby port toun o Whitby an introduced him tae the shipwricht John Walker, that gied him employ as a prentice on a collier that distributit coal alang the Inglis coast. Whan wirkin tae Walker, Cook begoud tae study algebra, trigonometry, navigation, an astronomy, skeels he wad need ae day for tae commaund his ain gailey. Cook rose in the ranks o the merchand fleet but tint the commaund o his ain collier in 1755 on the e'en o the navigation Years War for tae stairt ower at the neathmaist  level in the Breetish Ryal Navy.
Stanley Kubrick (Julie 26, 1928 – Mairch 7, 1999) wis an American film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematografer, eeditor, an photographer. He wis born in Manhattan an later moved tae Ingland.
Leonhard Euler [oi'lər] (15 Aprile 1707–18 September 1783) wis a Swiss mathematician an pheesicist. He is thocht ti be ane o the finest mathematicians that ivver leived. Leonhard Euler wis the first til uise the wird "function" (defined bi Leibniz in 1694) ti descreive an expression makkin uiss o various arguments; i.e., y = F(x). He is credited wi bein ane o the first til applee calculus ti pheesics.
Born an bred in Basel, he wis a mathematical child prodigy. He worked as a professor o mathematics in St. Petersburg, an aifter in Berlin, an then cam back ti St. Petersburg. He is the maist proleific mathematician bar nane, his collected wark fullin 75 volumes. He dominated the mathematics o the 1700s an worked oot mony consequences o the neow inventit calculus. He wis blind for the hindmaist seventeen year o his life, a time whan he produced near on hauf o aa his wark.
An asteroid haes been cried 2002 Euler in his honour.
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, cried Leibnitz or von Leibniz as weel (1 Julie (21 Juin Auld Style) 1646 – 14 November 1716) wis a German scientist that scrieved maistly in French an Latin.
He wis educate in law an philosophy. He wrocht as factotum tae twa muckle German noble hooses (ane becomin the Breetish ryal faimlie at the time he wis wirkin for it). Leibniz haed a muckle role in the European politics an diplomacy o his day. He haes juist as lairge a place baith in the history o philosophy an in the history o mathematics. He inventit calculus at the same time as Newton, an his notation is the ane in general uiss syne. He inventit the binary seestem forby, the foonds o juist aboot aw modren computers.
In philosophy, he is best mynt for optimism. His thocht wis that oor universe is, in ae sense, the best possible that God coud hae made. He wis ane o the great 17th century rationalists. Mony fowk sees René Descartes an Baruch Spinoza as the ither twa. His philosophy leuks back on the Scholastic tradeetion an leuks forrit on modren logic an analysis.
Leibniz made unco contreibutions tae pheesics an technology forby, an anteecipatit concepts that surfaced lang efter in biology, medicine, geology, probability theory, psychology, an information science. He wrate on politics, law, ethics, theology, history, an philology, an aw. Whiles he e'en wrate in verse. His contreebutions tae this muckle array o subjects is scattered in jurnals, in tens o thoosands o letters, an in unpublished manuscripts. As o 2006, thare isna ony complete edeetion o Leibniz's writins, sae a full accoont o his accomplishments isna yet possible.
Confucius (Kǒng Fūzǐ in pinyin, 孔夫子 in Chinese mandarin) (551 - 479 BC) wis a Cheenese thinker an social philosopher, whase teachins an philosophy hae deeply influenced Cheenese, Korean, Japanese an Vietnamese thocht an life. He stairtit the Cheenese releegion an philosophy ca'd Confucianism.
Karl Marx (5t Mey 1818 in Trier, Germany – 14t Mairch 1883 in Lunnon, UK) wis a German philosopher and poleitical thinker that wrat aboot economics an politics. His first beuk wis the Communist Manifesto, written thegither wi Friedrich Engels in 1848. In this beuk thay set oot the ideas an ettles o the Communist muvement for the first time. His theories wis gien the name Marxism efterhaund, baith bi thaim that gree'd wi him an thaim that criticeesed him.
His maist important contreibution is thocht tae be his beuk Das Kapital that wis written ower monie decades; in it he analeesed, criticeesed, an gied the name tae the seestem o caipitalism. 
For the maist pairt it disagreed wi leiberal economic views an haes led tae gran debates atween its supporters an detractors. Juist the ae volume haed been feenisht bi the time Marx dee'd; Engels teuk his jots an completit twa mair volumes.
Karl Marx wis born in Trier, Germany, on the 5th o May, 1818, and dee'd on the 14th o Mairch, 1883,
Alexander the Great (Greek leid: Μέγας Αλέξανδρος) (Julie 20 or 26, 356 BC - Juin 10 323 BC) wis a Auncient Greek king. He wis learnt maist o his skeels in Athens durin his bairnheid. He is kent for his meelitary skeels. He invadit a muckle empire cried Persie, an gaed on tae invade pairts o Central Asie an Indie. He is aft said tae be ane o the greatest military commanders in heestory, alang wi Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Subutai, Napoleon I o Fraunce, an ithers. Bi the time o his daith he had owerhailt maist o the Middle Eastern yird kent tae Europeans, alang wi a muckle pairt o Central Asie that includit Persia, Egypt, an Asie Minor. He dee'd in Babylon in 323 BC. 
Elizabeth I (cried "Elizabeth" until Elizabeth II teuk the Breetish throne; 7 September 1533 – 24 Mairch 1603) wis Queen o Ingland an Queen o Ireland frae 17 November 1558 till her strae-daith. Elizabeth wis the fift an pokeshakkins o the ryal Hoose o Tudor. The dochter o Henry VIII, she wis born a princess, but her mither, Anne Boleyn, wis executit three year efter her birth.
Thomas Aquinas, OP (/əˈkwaɪnəs/; 1225 – 7 March 1274), kent as Thomas o Aquin or Aquino forby, wis an Italian[3][4] Dominican friar an priest an an gye influential filosopher an theologian in the tradetioun o scholasticism, athin whilk he is kent as the "Doctor Angelicus", "Doctor Communis", an "Doctor Universalis".[5]
Logic (frae Greek λογική, logike)[1]  oreeginally meanin the wird, or whit is spoken, (but comin tae mean thocht or raison)  is generally held tae conseest o the seestematic study o the form o valid arguments.
Thocht can refer tae the ideas or arrangements o ideas that result frae thinkin, the act o producin thochts, or the process o producin thochts.
Reason is the capacity for consciously makin sense o things, applyin logic, for establishing an verifyin facts, an chyngin or juistifyin practices, institutions, an beliefs based on new or existin information.[2]
Confucianism, cried Ruism an aa, is descrived as tradeetion, a filosofie, a releegion, a humanistic or raitionalistic releegion, a wey o govrening, or simply a wey o life.[1] Confucianism developed frae whit wis later cried the Hunder Schuils o Thocht frae the teachins o the Cheenese filosofer Confucius (551–479 BCE), wha conseedert himsel a retransmitter o the values o the Zhou dynasty gowden age o several centuries afore.[2]
A human society is a group o fowk involved in persistent interpersonal relationships, or a muckle social groupin sharin the same geografical or social territory, typically subject tae the same poleetical authority an dominant cultural expectations.
Democracie (or democracy) is a poleetical form o govrenment in which governin pouer is derived frae the fowk, aither bi direct referendum (direct democracie) or bi means o electit representatives o the fowk (representative democracie).[1]  The term comes frae the Greek: δημοκρατία – (dēmokratía) "rule o the fowk",[2] which wis coined frae δῆμος (dêmos) "fowk" an κράτος (Kratos) "pouer", in the middle o the 5t-4t centurie BC tae denote the poleetical seestems then existin in some Greek ceetie-states, notablie Athens follaein a popular uprisin in 508 BC.[3]
Even tho thare is nae specific, universallie acceptit definition o 'democracie',[4] equalitie an freedom hae been identified as important characteristics o democracie syne ancient times.[5] Thir principles are reflectit in aw ceetizens bein equal afore the law an haein equal access tae pouer. For ensaumple, in a representative democracie, iverie vote haes equal wecht, nae restrictions can apply tae onyane wantin tae acome a representative, an the freedom o its ceetizens is secured bi legitimized richts an liberties which are generallie protectit bi a constitution.[6][7]
Thare are several varieties o democracie, some o which provide better representation an mair freedoms for thair ceetizens than ithers.[8][9] Housomeivver, if onie democracie is no carefullie legislatit – throu the uise o balances – tae avoid an uneven distribution o poleetical pouer, sic as the separation o pouers, then a branch o the seestem o rule coud accumulate pouer sicweys acome undemocratic.[10][11][12]
The "majoritie rule" is aften describit as a characteristic featur o democracie, but athoot governmental or constitutional protections of individual liberties, it is possible for a minoritie o individuals tae be oppressed bi the "tyrannie o the majoritie". An essential process in representative democracies is competitive elections that are fair baith substantively[13] an procedurallie.[14] Furthermore, freedom o poleetical expression, freedom o speech, an freedom o the press are essential sae that ceetizens are informed an able tae vote in thair personal interests.[15][16]
Popular sovereigntie is common but no a universal motivatin subject for establishin a democracie.[17] In some kintras, democracie is based on the philosophical principle o equal richts. Monie fowk uise the term "democracie" as shorthand for liberal democracie, which mey include additional elements sic as political pluralism; equalitie afore the law; the right to petition elected officials for redress of grievances; due process; civil liberties; human richts; an elements o ceevil societie ootside the govrenment.
In the Unitit States, separation o pouers is aften cited as a supportin attribute, but in ither kintras, sic as the Unitit Kinrick, the dominant philosophie is parliamentarie sovereigntie (tho in practice judicial independence is generallie maintained). In ither cases, "democracie" is uised tae mean direct democracie. Tho the term "democracie" is typicallie uised in the context o a  poleetical state, the principles are applicable tae private organizations an ither groups an aa.
Democracie haes its oreegins in Auncient Greece.[18][19] Housomeivver ither culturs hae significantlie contributit tae the evolution o democracie sic as Ancient Rome,[18] Europe,[18] an North an South Americae.[20] The concept o representative democracie arose largelie frae ideas an institutions that developed durin the European Middle Ages an the Age o Enlichtenment an in the American an French Revolutions.[21] Democracie haes been cried the "last form of government" an haes spread considerably across the globe.[22] The richt tae vote haes been expandit in monie Jurisdictions ower time frae relatively narrae groups (sic as wealthie men o a parteecular ethnic group), wi New Zealand the first naition tae grant universal suffrage for aw its ceetizens in 1893.
Socialism is the name gien tae sindrie poleitical ideas. Socialists believes in evenlyness, solidarity, an social juistice. Monie fowk haes unalike conceits anent whit socialism means. Monie socialists thinks the guvrenment or the state shuid be aucht the "commandin hichts" o industry. Ithers thinks that warkers shuid be aucht the industries that thay wirk in. The'r ithers that says that the ettle shoud be that fowk shuid be mair equal, but this shoud be gotten unner a reformed capitalism.
Some fowk says that an Inglisman, Robert Owen, wis the first socialist. He sayed that warkers shoud be aucht the companies that thay wrocht tae. The warkers wad than divvie up the ootcome amang thairsels.
Monie socialist poleitical pairties wis creatit in the 19t century an the early pairt o the 20t century.
The maist weel-kent socialist is Karl Marx, that scrieved The Communist Manifesto.
Socialism an communism is sib ane tae the ither, but no the same thing. Nouadays, socialism is a gey wide-rangin term, while communism in ordiner spaek aamaist aye refers juist tae the ideologies o the Marxist-Leninist pairties o the communist bloc.
Efter Warld Weir Ane, the faa o the Saicont International an the Roushian Revolution, socialism wis splitten intae twa tradeitions. Some socialists follaed Lenin an wis cryed Communists. Ithers believed in a pairlamentary gate tae socialism an wis cawed social democrats. Social democrats disagreed gey strangly wi Communists; afttimes thay entered intae guvrenments in thair naitions, cryed "bourgeois guvrenments" bi the socialists, an stertit tae rule ower capitalist kintras.
Monie social democrats haes nou quat e'en thair auld idea o reformin capitalism, an rins capitalist guvernments aa roond the warld.
Monie fowk that nou cries thairsels socialists is opponed tae baith capitalism, an the seestem o the auld Soviet Union that thay see (specially efter the rise o Joseph Stalin) as a betrayal o the principles o democratic socialism.
Siller or money is onything that is for ordinar accepted in payment for guids an services an in repayment o dets.[1] The main uises o siller are as a medium o exchynge, a unit o accoont, an a store o vailyie.[2]
A currency is a unit o exchynge, faceelitatin the transfer o guids an services. It is a form o siller, an it is conseedert a store o vailyie bi mony fowk an aw, that's shaped bi a claim tae its central baunk assets. A currency zone is a kintra or region that haes a specific currency as the dominant medium o exchynge. For tae faceelitate troke atween currency zones, thare's exchynge rates i.e. prices that currencies (an the guids an services o indiveedual currency zones) can be exchynged agin ilk ither for. Currencies can be classifee'd as aither fleetin currencies or fixed currencies based on their exchynge rate regime. In common uiss, currency whiles refers anerly tae paper money, as in "cunyies an currency", but this is misleadin. Cunyies an paper money is baith forms o currency.
Greek (Greek: ελληνική γλώσσα or semply ελληνικά — "Hellenic") haes a documentit history o 3,400 year, the langest o ony single naitural leid in the Indo-European leid faimily. It is ane o the earliest attestit Indo-European leids an aw, wi fragmentary records in Mycenaean datin back tae the 15t or 14t century BC, makkin it the warld's auldest recordit leevin leid. The day, it is spoken bi aboot 17–25 million fowk in Greece (offeecial), Cyprus (offeecial), Albanie, Bulgarie, North Macedonie, Italy, Turkey, Armenie, Georgie, Ukraine, Moldovae, Romanie, Roushie, Egyp, Jordan an emigrant communities athort the warld, includin Australie, Unitit States, Canadae, Germany an ithergates. 
Greek haes been written in the Greek alphabet (the auldest conteenasly uised alphabet, an the first tae introduce vouels) syne the 9t century BC in Greece (afore that in Linear B), an the 4t century BC in Cyprus (afore that in Cypriot seelabary). Greek literature haes a conteenas history o near-haund three thoosand year.

The grammar o a leid is a set o rules tae produce sentences in thon leid.
The term refers baith tae rules that descrives whit fowk actually says (descriptive grammar), an thaim that prescrives whit fowk shuid say (prescriptive grammar). The term grammar whan uised in schuils for ordinar refers tae prescriptive grammar, but linguists mair aften uises grammar wi the first o thae meanins. Linguists uises the seimilar term seentax tae refer tae the internal structur o sentences produced bi a grammar.
Baith linguists an computer scientists, specially thaim in the field o naitural langage processin, ettles tae pit thegither grammars that wad generate aa an juist the grammatical sentences o a leid. Whit a grammatical sentence is in an artifeicial leid, sic as a programmin leid, can be strickly defined; for normal, whit a grammatical sentence is in a naitural leid can be jaloused bi native spaekers o thon leid juist. 
Leeteratur is leiterally "an acquent wi letters" (frae the Latin littera meanin "the ae written chairacter (letter)"). The term haes maistly come til identifee a collection o texts. The wird "leeteratur" as a common noon can refer til onie kin o writin, sic as essays; "Leeteratur" as a proper noon refers til a hail bodie o leiterar wark, global or anent the ae cultur. Monie a time there's confusion on the actual defineition o leeteratur an Leeteratur. The wird "leeteratur" can be baith singular an plural, juist like "Literatur". Sayin that, "leeteraturs" is plural forby. Houaniver "Leeteratur", wi emphasis on uppercase L, is a subset o the mair wide-reengin "leeteratur". "Leeteratur" is uised for onie written wark o byordinar intellectual calibre, whiles "leeteratur" can be oniething written. Sae, War and Peace bi Tolstoy is "Leeteratur" (singular) as weel as "leeteratur" (singular), but Charles Dickens's wark is pairt o "Leeteratur" (plural) as weel as "leeteratur" (plural). Mairanower a Harry Potter novel will be thocht on as "leeteratur" (singular) but nae as "Leeteratur" (singular) sith maist fowk wadna deem the beuks as intellectual or meaninfu eneuch at an academic level. Likewice the Harry Potter collection bi J. K. Rowling will be thocht on as "leeteratur" (plural) but nae as "Leeteratur" (plural). What is intellectual an meaninfu is subjective an aften controversial or dubious, but it daesna interfere wi the defineition abuin.
Maurs (or Mairs; symbol: ) is the fowert planet frae the Sun in the Solar system. It is cried efter Maurs, the god o war in Roman mythology (the coonterpairt til Ares, the god o war in Greek mythology) acause o its reid licht as seen in the heivens at nicht. This featur forby wan it the name o "the Reid Planet". Maurs haes twa muins (Phobos an Deimos) baith smaa an orra-shapit, like eneuch bein fangit asteroids. Both satellites were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall[1]; they are named after the characters Phobos (panic/fear) and Deimos (terror/dread), who, in Greek mythology, accompanied their father Ares, god of war, into battle[2]. The prefix areo- refers ti Maurs.
Maurs haes been in fiction for mony a year gin only as the stance the invaders cam frae. Stories that taks place on Maurs haes slawly becam mair faur ben – includin Bradbury's Maurtian chronicles.
Proteins are lairge biological molecules, or macromolecules, consistin o ane or mair chains o amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array o functions athin organisms, includin catalysin metabolic reactions, DNA replication, respondin tae stimuli, an transportin molecules frae ane location tae anither. Proteins differ frae ane anither primarily in thair sequence o amino acids, that is dictatit bi the nucleotide sequence o thair genes, an that uisually results in protein foldin intae a speceefic three-dimensional structur that determines its acteevity.
A linear cheen o amino acid residues is cried a polypeptide. A protein conteens at least ane lang polypeptide. Short polypeptides, conteenin less nor 20–30 residues, are rarely conseedert tae be proteins an are commonly cried peptides, or whiles oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bondit thegither bi peptide bonds an adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence o amino acid residues in a protein is defined bi the sequence o a gene, that is encodit in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifees 20 staundart amino acids; houiver, in certaint organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine an—in certaint archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly efter or even in synthesis, the residues in a protein are eften chemically modifee'd bi post-translational modification, that alters the pheesical an chemical properties, fauldin, stability, activity, an ultimately, the function o the proteins. Whiles proteins hae non-peptide groups attached, that can be cried prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can an aa wirk thegither tae achieve a pairteecular function, an thay eften associate tae form stable protein complexes.
Ance formed, proteins anerly exeest for a certaint period o time an are then degradit an recycled bi the cell's machinery throu the process o protein turnower. A protein's lifespan is meisurt in terms o its hauf-life an covers a wide range. Thay can exist for minutes or years wi an average lifespan o 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfauldit proteins are degradit mair rapidly aither due tae bein targetit for destruction or due tae bein unstable.
Lik ither biological macromolecules sic as polysaccharides an nucleic acids, proteins are essential pairts o organisms an pairteecipate in virtually ivery process within cells. Mony proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions an are vital tae metabolism. Proteins an aa hae structural or mechanical functions, sic as actin an myosin in muscle an the proteins in the cytoskeleton, that form a system o scaffauldin that maintains cell shape. Ither proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, an the cell cycle. In ainimals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that canna be synthesised. Digestion braks the proteins doun for uise in the metabolism.
Proteins mey be purified frae ither cellular components uisin a variety of techniques sic as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, an chromatography; the advent o genetic ingineerin haes made possible a nummer o methods tae facilitate purification. Methods commonly uised tae study protein structur an function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallografie, nuclear magnetic resonance an mass spectrometry.
The smaw thairm is a thairm, an a pairt o mony leevin beins. It lees atween the painch an the lairge thairm. In humans ower 5 year auld, a smaw thraim micht be five tae sax metre lang. It is langer nor the muckle thairms. But, as its diameter is less, its name is the smaw thairms.
It is in the smaw thairm, whaur nutrients o fuids get absorbed.
The buffs, whiles cried lichts, is an organ in mony vertebrates (ainimals haein a rig-bane). It gies bluid oxygen frae the air, an taks awa carbon dioxide. Maist vertebrates hae twa buffs.
In ainimals, the buffs is the aurie whaur respiration taks place. Athoot respiration in the buffs, ainimals wadna survive as the bouk cells wadna be able tae receive the oxygen needed.
A mental disorder, cried a mental illness[1] or psychiatric disorder an aa, is a diagnosis bi a mental heal professional o a behavioural or mental pattern that mey cause sufferin or a puir ability tae function in life.
Antibiotics or antibacterials are a type o antimicrobial uised specifically against bacteria,[1][2] an are eften uised in medical treatment o bacterial infections.[1]
Ainimals is multicellular, eukaryotic organisms o the kinrick Animalia (forby cried Metazoa). Aw ainimals are motile, meanin thay can muiv spontaneously an independently, at some pynt in thair lifes. Thair body plan hidnerly becomes fixed as thay develop, tho some unnergang a process o metamorphosis later on in thair lifes. Aw ainimals is heterotrophs: thay maun ingest ither organisms or thair products for sustenance.
Maist kent ainimal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species in the Cambrian explosion, aboot 542 million year syne. Ainimals is dealt intae sindry sub-groups, some o whilk is: vertebrates (birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish); molluscs (clams, eysters, octopuses, ink-fish, snails); arthropods (meggie-mony-feets, jennie-hunder-feets, insects, speeders, scorpions, keavies, lapsters, saund-clapper); annelids (yirdwirms, gells); spoonges; an loch-livers.
Fish are the gill-beirin aquatic craniate ainimals that lack limms wi deegits. Thay form a sister group tae the tunicates, thegither formin the olfactores. Includit in this defineetion are the leevin hagfish, lampers, an cartilaginous an banie fish as weel as various extinct relatit groups. Tetrapods emerged athin lobe-finned fishes, sae cladistically thay are fish as weel. Houiver, tradeetionally fish are rendered paraphyletic bi excludin the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds an mammals). Acause in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is nae conseedert a formal taxonomic groupin in seestematic biology. The tradeetional term pisces (an aa ichthyes) is conseedert a teepological, but nae a phylogenetic clessification.
The earliest organisms that can be clessifee'd as fish war saft-bodied chordates that first appeared in the Cambrian period. Awtho thay lacked a true spine, thay possessed notochords that alloued them tae be mair agile nor thair invertebrate coonterpairts. Fish wad conteena tae evolve throu the Paleozoic era, diversifeein intae a wide variety o forms. Mony fish o the Paleozoic developed external airmour that pertectit them frae predators. The first fish wi jaws appeared in the Silurian period, efter that mony (sic as shairks) becam formidable marine predators raither than juist the prey o arthropods.
Maist fish are ectothermic ("cauld-bluidit"), allouin thair bouk temperaturs tae vary as ambient temperaturs cheenge, tho some o the lairge active soummers lik white shark an tuna can hauld a heicher core temperatur.[1][2] Fish are abundant in maist bouks o watter. Thay can be foond in nearly aw aquatic environments, frae heich moontain streams (e.g., Salvelinus an gudgeon) tae the abyssal an even hadal deepths o the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers an anglerfish). Wi 33,600 descrived species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than ony ither group o vertebrates.[3]
Fish are an important resoorce for humans warldwide, especially as fuid. Commercial an subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishin) or ferm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquacultur). Thay are an aa catcht bi recreautional fishers, kept as pets, raised bi fishkeepers, an exhibitit in public aquaria. Fish hae haed a role in cultur throu the ages, servin as deities, releegious seembols, an as the subjects o airt, beuks an films.
Bodies ar bipedal primates belangin tae the mammalian genus Homo (fae Laitin: Hūmānō or "the same") in the faimily Hominidae (the great apes).[1][2] Compeart wi ither genus', bodies hae unco developit harns capable o abstract raesonin, leid, an introspection. This mental capabeelitie, soudered wi an erect bouk cairiage that frees thair ower limms fer maneepulatin objects, haes alloud bodies tae mak faur mair uiss o tuils than onie ither genus.

Biochemistry, sometimes cried biological chemistry, is the study o chemical processes within an relatin tae livin organisms.[1]
Airn is a chemical element in the periodic chart  that haes the symbol Fe (L.: Ferrum) an atomic nummer 26. Airn is a group 8 an period 4 Metal. Airn is kent for bein the last element made bi stellar nucleosynthesis, an sicweys the maist wechtie element that disna require a supernova or seemilar catacleesmic event for tae be furmed. It is, tharefore, the maist rowthie wechtie metal in the universe. main metal in the core o the earth. this is a great metal it wis uised syne the begining o times
Wather is the state o the air, descrivin fur ensaumple if hit's het or cauld, dreich or bonny, clearsome or cluddy. Oan Yird, maist wather effeck happen in the lawest level o the lift. Wather refers tae day-tae-day temperatur an effecks, while climate refers tae effecks ower time.
Wather kin be preedectit bi yaisin science an technology at wather stations. Wance spaed, the wather is reportit by watherfowk. Due tae the fickle nature ae wather, reports kin be verra unricht. Wather reports kin be used tae pertect life an aiverel.
Electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) is ane o the fundamental phenomena o electromagnetism, behavin as waves propagatin through space, an an aa as photon pairticles travelin through space, carryin radiant energy. In a vacuum, it propagates at a characteristic speed, the speed o licht, normally in straicht lines.  EMR is emitted an absorbed bi charged pairticles. As an electromagnetic wave, it haes baith electric an magnetic field components, which oscillate in a fixed relationship tae ane anither, perpendicular tae ilk ither an perpendicular tae the direction o energy an wave propagation.
In physics, mass (frae Greek μᾶζα "barley cake, lump [o daich]") is a property o a physical body which determines the body's resistance tae bein acceleratit bi a force an the strength o its mutual gravitational attraction wi ither bodies.
A semiconductor is a material which haes electrical conductivity atween that o a conductor sic as copper an that o an insulator sic as gless.
The SI (French Système internationale d'unités, Internaitional Seestem o Units) is a seestem o meisurin based on the metre for lenth or displacement, kilogram for mass, an saicont for time.
The metre, kilogram an saicont can be uised ane wi anither, makkin units o meisurment for ither quantities, sic as vollum, energy, pressur, an velocity.
Whan talkin anent lairger or smaaer meisurments, mair syllables is uised; for exemplar, kilometre means 1000 meter, an milligram means 1/1000 o a gram. The prefixes is shawn in the table on the richt-haund side.
The SI units wis thocht oot in Fraunce efter the French Revolution.
Thay are nou uised aa ower the warld, but thay arna gey popular in some kintras, sic as the Unitit States.
Even the Unitit Kinrick, that creatit the auld US units o meisurment, is nou "metric", acause o staundardeisation athort the European Union.
The SI base units is meisurments uised bi scientists an ither fowk aroond the warld. Aa the other units can be screived bi pittin thir seeven base units thegither in different weys. Thir units is cryed derivate units.
A cereal is a gress, a member o the monocot faimily Poaceae,[1] cultivatit for the edible components o its grain (botanically, a teep o fruit cried a caryopsis), componed o the endosperm, germ, an bran.
Bananae is the common name for a fruit an the herbaceous plaunts o the genus Musa whit mak this commonly eten fruit.  Thay are hameart tae the tropical airts o Sootheast Asie. Bananaes is likely tae hae been first domesticatit in Papua New Guinea.[1]  The day, thay are cultivatit thro-oot the tropics.[2]
Bananae plaunts is o the faimlie Musaceae. Thay are cultivatit maistly for thair fruit, an tae a lesser extent for the makkin o fibre an as ornamental plaunts. As the bananae plaunts is for ordinar stilpert an fairly sturdy thay are aften miskent as trees, bit thair main or upricht stem is actually a pseudostem (leeterally "fake stem"). For some speshes this pseudostem can reak a hicht o up tae 2–8 m, wi leafs o up tae 3.5 m in lenth. Each pseudostem can mak a bunch o yellae, green or even reid bananaes afore deein an bein replaced bi anither pseudostem.
The bananae fruit grow in hangin clusters, wi up tae 20 fruit tae a tier (cried a haud), an 3-20 tiers tae a bunch. The tot o the hingin clusters is kent as a bunch, or commercially as a "bananae stem", an can weich fae 30–50 kg. The fruit averages 125 g, o whilk aboot 75% is watter an 25% dry matter content. Ilka individual fruit (kent as a bananae or 'finger') haes a protective ooter layer (a peel or skin) wi a fleshy edible inner portion. Baith skin an inner pairt can be etten raw or cuikit. Westren cultures generally eat the inner pairt raw an thraw awa the skin while some Asien culturs generally eat baith the skin an in o it cuikit. Teepically, the fruit haes monie strings (cried 'phloem bundles') whilk rin atween the skin an inner pairt.  Bananaes is a valuable soorce o vitamin B6, vitamin C, an potassium.
Tea is a caffeine-conteenin drink, an infusion makkit bi steepin the kistit  leafs or the wee flouers o the buss Camellia sinensis in het watter for a few meenits. Forby, tea micht include ither yerbs, spices, or fruit gusts.
In mathematics, a function[1] is a relation atween a set o inputs an a set o permissible ootputs wi the property that ilka input is relatit tae exactly ane ootput. An example is the function that relates ilka real nummer x tae its square x2. The ootput o a function f correspondin tae an input x is denotit bi f(x) (reid "f o x"). In this example, if the input is −3, then the ootput is 9, an we mey write f(−3) = 9. The input variable(s) are sometimes referred tae as the argument(s) o the function.
A pleuch (cutty form plou) is a semple machine uised in fermin. A pleuch is pulled athort the grund bi a body or ainimal or tractor. Whan pulled athort the grund, the plou lifts up syle an maks twa lines o muild ahint it. The syle lifted bi the pleuch is mair lowse nor afore. Grund that haes been pleuched is a guid place for a fermer tae growe fuid.

Auncient Greece wis a Greek civilisation belangin tae a period o Greek history that lastit frae the Archaic period o the 8t tae 6t centuries BC tae the end o antiquity (ca. 600 AD).
Aw throu the 18ct century, Auncient Greek an Rouman cultur (affen cryed Clessical Culture) wis muckle admired in Scotland bi the educatit an upper clesses, an thay attemptit tae copy a wheen ideas. This scweel o thocht is mirrart in, for instance, the airchitectur o gran kintra an public biggins that haed intil them Greek columns an Roman facades. The Scots leid wis noo compared wi the ‘Doric’ spik o auncient Greece (spoken in Doria) file Inglis became associate wi ‘Attic’ (the leid o the city states).
The Ming Deenasty, kent as the Empire o the Great Ming an aw, wis the rulin dynasty o Cheenae for 276 years (1368–1644) followin the collapse o the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty. The Ming, describit bi some as "ane o the greatest eras o orderly govrenment an social stability in human history",[5] wis the last dynasty in Cheenae ruled bi ethnic Han Cheenese. Awtho the primary caipital o Beijing fell in 1644 tae a rebellion led bi Li Zicheng (who established the Shun Dynasty, suin replaced bi the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty), regimes lyal tae the Ming throne – collectively cried the Soothren Ming – survived till 1662.
The Hongwu Emperor (ruled 1368–98) attemptit tae creaut a society o self-sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid, immobile seestem that wad guarantee an support a permanent cless o soldiers for his dynasty:[6] the empire's staundin airmy exceedit ane million troops an the navy's dockyards in Nanjing wur the lairgest in the warld.[7] He an aa teuk great care breakin the pouer o the coort eunuchs[8] an unrelatit magnates, enfeoffing his mony sons throughoot Cheenae an attemptin tae guide thir princes throu published dynastic instructions. This failed spectacularly whan his teen-aged successor attemptit tae curtail his uncles' pouer, promptin the uprisin that placed the Prince o Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402. The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a seicontar caipital an renamed it Beijing, constructit the Forbidden Ceety, an restored the Grand Canal an the primacy o the imperial examinations in offeecial appointments. He rewardit his eunuch supporters an employed them as a coonterweicht against the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats. Ane, Zheng He, led seiven enormous voyages o exploration intae the Indian Ocean as far as Arabie an the coast o Africae.
The rise o new emperors an new factions diminished sic extravagances; the capture o the Zhengtong Emperor durin the 1449 Tumu Crisis endit them completely. The imperial navy wis allowed tae faw intae disrepair while forced labor constructit the Liaodong palisade an connectit an fortified the Great Waw o Cheenae intae its modren form. Wide-rangin censuses o the entire empire wur conductit decennially, but the desire tae avoid labor an taxes an the difficulty o storin an reviewin the enormous archives at Nanjing hampered accurate figures.[6] Estimates for the late-Ming population vary frae 160 tae 200 million,[9] but necessar revenues wur squeezed oot o smawer an smawer nummers o fairmers as mair disappeared frae the offeecial records or "donatit" thair launds tae tax-exempt eunuchs or temples.[6] Haijin laws intendit tae pertect the coasts frae "Japanese" pirates instead turned mony intae smugglers an pirates themselves.
Bi the 16t century, houiver, the expansion o European tred – albeit restrictit tae islands near Guangzhou lik Macao – spreid the Columbian Exchange o crops, plants, an ainimals intae Cheenae, introducin chili peppers tae Sichuan cuisine an heichly-productive corn an tatties, which diminished faimins an spurred population growthe. The growthe o Portuguese, Spaingie, an Dutch trade creatit new demand for Cheenese products an produced a massive influx o Japanese an American siller. This abundance o specie allowed the Ming tae finally avoid uisin paper money, which haed sparked hyperinflation durin the 1450s. While tradeetional Confucians opposed sic a prominent role for commerce an the newly rich it creatit, the heterodoxy introducit bi Wang Yangming permittit a mair accommodatin attitude. Zhang Juzheng's initially successfu reforms proved devastatin whan a slowdoun in agriculture produced bi the Little Ice Age wis met wi Japanese an Spaingie policies that quickly cut aff the supply o siller nou necessar for fairmers tae be able tae pey thair taxes. Combined wit crop failure, floods, an epidemic, the dynasty wis considered tae hae lost the Mandate o Heaven an collapsed afore the rebel leader Li Zicheng an a Manchurian invasion.
A ceety is a place whaur a heest o fowk bides thegither. A ceety haes a wheen biggins an gates. It haes hooses or tennements for a lot o fowk tae bide in, shops whaur thay micht can buy things, pairts for fowk tae wirk an a govrenment organisation for tae rin the ceety, an for tae keep law an order in the ceety. A heest o fowk bides in ceeties acause it is eith for thaim tae airt oot an dae the things thay want thare. A ceety for ordinar haes a "ceety centre" whaur govrenment an business is duin, an pairts cryed suburbs whaur fowk bides aroond the ootside o the centre. 
Thare's no a rule that is uised athort the warld for tae decide whit for some places is cryed "ceeties" an ither places is cryed "touns".

The Republic o Cuba (Spaingie pronunciation: [ˈkuβa]) is a kintra in the Americaes. It conseests o the island o Cuba (the maist muckle an secont-maist populous island o the Greater Antilles), the island o Isla de la Juventud, an monie adjacent wee islands.
Havana is the maist muckle city in Cuba an is the kintra's caipital. Santiago de Cuba an Camagüey are major Cuban cities an aw. Better kent smawer clachans include: Baracoa (that wis the first Spanis sattlement on Cuba), Trinidad (a UNESCO Warld Heritage Steid), an Bayamo.
Cuba is hame tae ower 11 million fowk an is the maist populous insular naition in the Caribbean. Its fowk, cultur, an customs draw fae diverse soorces sic as: the auncient Taíno an Ciboney fowk; the period o Spaingie colonialism; the introduction o African thralls; an its proximity tae the Unitit States.
Most of the economy depends on remittances.
Mexico (Spaingie: México [ˈmexiko] ( listen); Nahuatl leids: Mēxihco), offeecially the Unitit Mexican States (Spaingie: Estados Unidos Mexicanos, listen (help·info)),[8][9][10][11] is a federal republic in the soothrenmist portion o North Americae. It is mairchit tae the north bi the Unitit States; tae the sooth an wast bi the Paceefic Ocean; tae the sootheast bi Guatemala, Belize, an the Caribbean Sea; an tae the east bi the Gulf o Mexico.[12] Kiverin awmaist 2,000,000 square kilometre (770,000 sq mi),[11] the naition is the fift lairgest kintra in Americae bi tot aurie an the 13t lairgest independent state in the warld.
Wi an estimatit population o ower 120 million fowk,[13] the kintra is the elevent maist populous state an the maist populous Spaingie-speakin state in the warld, while bein the seicont maist populous naition in Laitin Americae efter Brazil. Mexico is a federation compreesin 31 states an Mexico Ceety, a special federal entity that is also the caipital ceety an its maist populous ceety. Ither metropolises in the state include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, an Tijuana.
Mexico haes the 15t lairgest nominal GDP an the 11t lairgest bi purchasin pouer parity. The Mexican economy is strangly airtit tae thae o its 1994 North American Free Tred Greement (NAFTA) pairtners, espeshally the Unitit States.[14][15] In 1994, Mexico becam the first Laitin American member o the Organisation for Economic Co-operation an Development (OECD). It is clessifee'd as an upper-middle income kintra bi the Warld Bank[16] an a newly industrialised kintra bi several analysts.[17][18][19][20] The kintr is conseedert aith a regional pouer an a middle pouer,[21][22][23][24] an is eften identifee'd as an emergin global pouer.[25] Due tae its rich cultur an history, Mexico ranks first in Americae an seivent in the warld for nummer o UNESCO Warld Heritage Steids.[26][27] Mexico is an ecologically megadiverse kintra, rankin fowert in the warld for its biodiversity. Mexico haes mony tourists: in 2016, it wis the aicht maist-veesitit kintra in the warld, wi 35 million internaitional arrivals.[28] Mexico is a member o the Unitit Naitions (UN), the Warld Trade Organisation (WTO), the G8+5, the G20, the Unitin for Consensus group o the UN, an the Paceefic Alliance tred bloc. Bi 2050, Mexico coud potentially acome the warld's fift or seivent lairgest economy.[29][30]
Pre-Columbian Mexico dates tae aboot 8000 BC an is identifee'd as ane o seiven cradles o ceevilisation an wis hame tae mony advanced Mesoamerican ceevilisations sic as the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, an Aztec afore first contact wi Europeans. In 1521, the Spaingie Empire conquered an colonised the territory frae its poleetically pouerfu base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan (pairt o Mexico Ceety), that wis admeenistert as the viceryalty o New Spain. Three centuries later, the territory becam a naition state follaein its recogneetion in 1821 efter the colony's Mexican War o Unthirldom. The post-unthirldom period wis tumultuous, chairacterised bi economic inequality an mony intense poleetical chynges. The Mexican–American War (1846–1848) led te a territorial cession o the extant northren territories tae the Unitit States. The Pastry War, the Franco-Mexican War, a ceevil war, twa empires, an the Porfiriato occurred in the 19t century. The Porfiriato wis endit bi the stairt o the Mexican Revolution in 1910, that culminatit wi the promulgation o the 1917 Constitution an the emergence o the kintra's current poleetical seestem as a democratic republic.
Swisserland (German: die Schweiz, French: la Suisse, Italian: Svizzera, Romansh: Svizra, Laitin: Helvetica), kent offeecially the Swiss Confederation (German: Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, French: Confédération Suisse, Italian: Confederazione Svizzera an Romansh: Confederaziun Svizra, Laitin: Confoederatio Helvetica), is an Alpine kintra in Central Europe. It is landlockit an haes the neebours Germany tae the North, Fraunce tae the Wast, Italy tae the Sooth an Austrick an Liechtenstein tae the East. Historically it wis a Confederation but syne 1848 it haes been a Federation. It haes a strang economy in finance an baunkin an haes a lang history o bein neutral baith poleetical an meelitar.
Baghdad (Persie[3][4][5][6]; Arabic: بغداد‎, Baġdād, IPA: [bæɣˈdæːd]) is the caipital o Iraq an o Baghdad Province, wi whilk it is coterminous. Haein a population estimatit atween 7 an 7.5 million, it is the lairgest ceety in Iraq[1][2] an the seicont lairgest ceety in the Arab Warld (efter Cairo, Egyp).
Locatit on the River Tigris, the ceety dates back tae the 8t century. Baghdad haes a past as a centre o the Arab an Muslim warld especially durin the Abbasid Caliphate.
Istanbul (Turkis: İstanbul [isˈtɑnbuɫ] ( listen)), historically kent as Constantinople an Byzantium, is the maist populous ceety in Turkey an the kintra's economic, cultural, an historic centre. Istanbul is a transcontinental ceety in Eurasie, straddlin the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe an Asie) atween the Sea o Marmara an the Black Sea. Its commercial an historical centre lies on the European side an aboot a third o its population leeves on the Asie side.[4]
The ceety is the admeenistrative centre o the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous wi Istanbul Province), baith hostin a population o aroond 14.7 million residents.[1] Istanbul is ane o the warld's maist populous ceeties an ranks as the warld's 7t-lairgest ceety proper an the lairgest European ceety.
Foondit unner the name o Byzantion (Βυζάντιον) on the Sarayburnu promontory aroond 660 BCE, the ceety developed tae acome ane o the maist signeeficant in history. Efter its reestablishment as Constantinople in 330 CE, it served as an imperial caipital for awmaist 16 centuries, during the Roman an Byzantine (330–1204 an 1261–1453), the Laitin (1204–1261), an the Ottoman (1453–1922) empires.[5] It wis instrumental in the advancement o Christianity during Roman an Byzantine times, afore the Ottomans conquered the ceety in 1453 an transformed it intae an Islamic stranghauld an the seat o the Ottoman Caliphate.[6]
Istanbul's strategic poseetion on the historic Silk Road,[7] rail networks tae Europe an the Middle East, an the anerly sea route atween the Black Sea an the Mediterranean hae produced a cosmopolitan populace, awtho less sae syne the establishment o the Turkis Republic in 1923. Owerleuked for the new caipital Ankara during the interwar period, the ceety haes syne regained much o its prominence. The population o the ceety haes increased tenfauld syne the 1950s, as migrants frae across Anatolie hae muived in an ceety leemits hae expandit tae accommodate them.[8][9] Airts, muisic, film, an cultural festivals war established at the end o the 20t century an continue tae be hostit bi the ceety the day. Infrastructur impruivements hae produced a complex transportation network.
Approximately 12.56 million foreign veesitors arrived in Istanbul in 2015, five year efter it wis named a European Caipital o Cultur, makkin the ceety the warld's fift maist popular tourist destination.[10] The ceety's biggest attraction is its historic centre, pairtially leetit as a UNESCO Warld Heritage Steid, an its cultural an enterteenment hub can be foond athort the ceety's naitural harbor, the Gowden Horn, in the Beyoğlu destrict. Considered a global ceety,[11] Istanbul haes ane o the fastest-growin metropolitan economies in the warld.[12] It hosts the heidquarters o mony Turkis companies an media ootlets an accoonts for mair nor a quarter o the kintra's gross domestic product.[13] Hopin tae caipitalise on its revitalisation an rapid expansion, Istanbul haes bid for the Simmer Olympics five times in twinty years.[14]
Mumbai (kent as Bombay, its umwhile offeecial name till 1995, an aw) is a naitural herbour on the wast coast o Indie, an is the caipital ceety o Maharashtra state. It's Indie's maist muckle ceety, an the 4t maist populous ceety proper in the warld. It's cawed the commercial caipital o Indie.
It haes the Bombay Stock Exchynge an aw major financial trokin is duin thare.
Locate on the Wast Coast o Indie, the group o islands that haes developit intae the ceety o Bombay, wis likely first recordit as the name o fish-carles whaur a group o Buddhist monks estaiblisht an ootpost durin the later Magadhan empire. The islands wis passed fae ae king tae anither for twa millenia, till the Breetish tred empire decidit tae forder the naitural herbour intil a ceety. In the fower hunder year syne, the ceety haes growen bi a series o laund reclamations that jynes the oreeginal islands intil ae mass the nou.
The ceety wis cried Bombay for maist o the last fower hunder years. The oreegin o the name is kittlie, but is aft thocht tae come fae the Portuguese phrase bom bahia meanin "guid bay". The name Mumbai haes been uised in the main local leids for as lang, an is ascribed tae the local goddess, Mumba (ai means "mither" in Marathi, the leid o the state o Maharashtra). The name o the ceety wis chynged tae Mumbai bi an act o the pairlament in 1995.
Jaloused tae hae aboot 15 meellion fowk, the ceety haes growen swith in the bygane fifty year. The main aurie cawed the "Island Ceety" haes the maist dear real estate in the hale o Indie. Acause o this, the ceety haes growen a lang wey intil the mainlaund baith tae the north an the east. It is no unuisual for fowk tae commute mair nor an oor tae wark ilka day. Gettin watter, pouer an fuid intil the ceety is a muckle job that's owerseen bi ceevic agencies, plannin bodies an fowk gaun aboot thair business.
Mumbai haes sister ceety agreements wi the follaein ceeties:[12]
Tokyo (Japanese: 東京, Tōkyō, "aestren caipital") is the hame tae the Japanese govrenment an the emperor, makkin it the Caipital o Japan. It is the naition's maist populous urban area an aw (12 million fowk, or aboot 10 percent o the kintra's population, bides in Tokyo), an ane o the 47 prefecturs o Japan.
Tokyo is locate in the Kanto region on the island o Honshu. Its centre is at 35°41' North, 139°46' Aest (35.68333, 139.7667), but its borders extends tae ootlyin islands in the Paceefic Ocean, some sae hyne awa as 1,000 km sooth o the mainlaund.
Tokyo is north-wast o Tokyo Bay, an is aboot 90 km aest-tae-wast an 25 km north-tae-sooth. It borders Chiba Prefectur tae the aest, Yamanashi Prefectur tae the wast, Kanagawa Prefectur tae the sooth, an Saitama Prefectur tae the north. Forby thon it conseests o islands in the Paceefic Ocean directly sooth—the Izu Islands is closest, while the Ogasawara Islands raxes ower 1,000 km awa fae mainland Japan.
Tokyo haes elieven sister ceeties/states:[4]
In addition, Tokyo haes a "pairtnership" agreement wi:
The Pacific Ocean is the maist muckle body o watter on Yird – at 165.2 million square kilometres in area, this ocean (the maist muckle pairt o the Yird Ocean) kivers aboot 32% o the yird's surface an is mair muckle nor aw the yird's laund thegither. Its name comes frae the Laitin name Mare Pacificum, "peacefu sea". It wis gien the name bi the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan.
The Sahara (Arabic: الصحراء الكبرى‎, aṣ-Ṣaḥrāʾ al-Kubrā , 'the Greatest Desert') is the warld's hettest desert, the third mucklest desert efter Antarcticae an the Arctic.[1] At ower 9,400,000 square kilometre (3,600,000 sq mi), it covers maist o North Africae, makkin it naur sae muckle as Cheenae or the Unitit States. The Sahara stents frae the Reid Sea, includin pairts o the Mediterranean coasts, tae the ootskirts o the Atlantic Ocean. Soothlins, it is deleemitit bi the Sahel, a belt o semi-arid tropical savanna that composes the northren region o central an wastren Sub-Saharan Africae.
Some o the saund dunes can reach 180 metre (590 ft) in heicht.[2] The name comes frae the plural Arabic leid wird for desert, (صحارى ṣaḥārā [3][4] [ˈsˤɑħɑ:rɑ:];[5][6]
Dromedar camels an gaits are the domesticatit ainimals maist commonly foond in the Sahara. Acause o its qualities o endurance an speed, the dromedary is the favorite ainimal uised bi nomads.
The daithstalker scorpion can be 10 cm (3.9 in) lang. Its venom conteens muckle amoonts o agitoxin an scyllatoxin an is vera dangerous; housamiver, a sting frae this scorpion rarely kills a healthy adult. 
Several species o tod live in the Sahara, includin the fennec tod, fauch tod an Rüppell's tod. The addax, a muckle white antelope, can gang near a year in the desert athoot drinkin. The dorcas gazelle is a north African gazelle that can gang for a lang time athoot watter. Ither notable gazelles include the Rhim gazelle an dama gazelle.
The Saharan cheetah (northwast African cheetah) lives in Algerie, Togo, Niger, Mali, Benin, an Burkina Faso. Thare remain less nor 250 matur cheetahs that is vera caitious, fleein ony human presence. The cheetah evits the sun frae Aprile tae October, seekin the shelter o scrogs lik balanites an acacias. Thay are unuisually fauch.[7][8]
Ither ainimals include the monitor lizards, hyrax, sand vipers, an smaa populations o African wild dug,[9] in mibbe anerly 14 kintras.[10] an ostrich.
Thare exist ither ainimals in the Sahara (birds in parteecular) sic as African sillerbill an black-faced firefinch, amang ithers. Thare are smaa desert crocodiles in Mauritanie an the Ennedi Plateau o Chad an aa.[11]
The central Sahara is estimate tae include five hunner species o plants, whilk is extremely law conseiderin the huge extent o the aurie. Plants lik acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny scrogs, an gresses hae adapted tae the arid condeetions, bi growin lawer tae evit watter loss bi strang winds, bi storin watter in thair thick stems tae uise it in dry periods, bi haein lang ruits that traivel horizontally tae reak the maximum aurie o watter an tae fin ony surface moistur an bi haein smaa thick leafs or needles tae prevent watter loss bi evapo-transpiration. Plant leafs mey dry oot totally an then recover.
Human activity is mair lik eneuch tae affect the habitat in auries o permanent watter (oases) or whaur watter comes close tae the surface. Here, the local pressur on naitural resoorces can be intense. The remainin populations o muckle mammals hae been greatly reduced bi huntin for fuid an recreation.
In recent years, development projects haes stairtit in the deserts o Algerie an Tunisie uisin irrigatit watter pumpit frae unnergroond aquifers. Thir schemes aften lead tae soil degradation an salinisation.
